alert are not the part of webelement so we have tp switch the webdriver from the page to the alert using switch keyword
switch alert return all the thing in the alert so that we can take control over it

alert
------
switchto.alert.accept - click ok
switchto.alert.dismiss--click cancel
switch.alert.gettext- get the text in the alert
switchto.alert.sendkeys -  for pass value to the input filed



authentication alert
---------------------
so in javascript the pompt can only handle with single text input filed
so if we want to pass username and password , we can pass username and password in url during get url
syntax
https//username:password@url  , username-admin ,password - admin
