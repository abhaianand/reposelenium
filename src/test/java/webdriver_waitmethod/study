wedriver have only 3 wait
1 implicit wait
2 explicit wait
3 fluent wait
- no such element exception - time desynchronization
- element not found- - xpath/id not proper
1 implicit wait
------------------
need to write only single time it will take care rest of the code
if the element is found with in time it will jump to next code or not found
it will wait for the defined time
even if not found even after the defined time it will throw error


2 explicit wait
-------------------
we have both time and condition - first declare and the use
first check the condition then check the time
it wait for condition for maximum time of 10s and then it will throws the error

3 fluent wait
--------------
first declare and the condition
syntax
wait<webdriver> object = new Fluentwait<webdrver>(driver)
                        .withtimeout(Duration.of seconds(30)) ---- normal time out
                        .pollingevery(Duration.ofseconds(5)) ----- frequency of checking , every 5seconds it go and check
                        .ignoring(nosuchelementexception.class); ---- suppose in every 5 seonds there is no elemnt it will throw exception and this line will handle the same
